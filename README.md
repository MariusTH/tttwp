This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## TTTWP ( Tic Tac Toe Web Paper )
Idea here is to create a simple webpage that should be mobile first, and end up being as secure and fast as writing down a tic tac toe board on a paper and pass it to someone.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
